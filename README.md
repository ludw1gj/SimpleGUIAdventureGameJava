# Simple GUI Adventure Game

I wanted to get some experience with Java Swing as one of courses for University for Semester 1 2018 uses it. So I
stumbled upon "How to make a Text Adventure Game with GUI in Java" by [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS94AD0gxLakurK-6jnqV1w)
on YouTube, and wanted to refactor it. If you haven't watched it, I recommend as it's a good introduction to Java Swing
and text adventure game logic.

The game is a simple GUI adventure game which uses Swing/AWT. My version of the code consists of 4 classes: Game,
GameWorld, GUI, and Player. I've tested the build on MacOS using Java 9 SE.
